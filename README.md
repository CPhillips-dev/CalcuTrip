# SDEV-140-GUI-Final-Project
This is a fully working tkinter GUI program that allows a user to calculate the total average MPG and fuel cost for a trip.

To use this program one must enter the demographics of a car such as year, make and and model. Next, the user needs to enter valid trip details into the form. Afterwards, the user can either write the data to a file or just view the program output results in the output window. Note. A user must enter a value greater than zero or the program will throw an error message saying: "Zero is not a valid input."
